# Delhi-Police-Partner
a java project showing how police department can adopt changes in its working system

In this Delhi Police Partner Project made in Netbeans,  I have displayed some advanced features which can be included in the current working system of Delhi Police .
Features: 
1. eTheft Window -
As cases related to theft of mobile are high in capital , so a seperate window for filing a E-theft Mobile can be a good idea as people can save lot of time for obtaininf FIR copy for deactivation of SIM.

2.Society Issues: 
  Many cases are filed regardng pity society problems and residents of area call police immediately if any argument is created. At that time more important cases can suffer so if people start filling eFIR or complaint for Society Issues seperately then , Police officers can tacckle these issues when they are free from big cases.
  
3.Lost and Found 
  Like any website it also has Lost and Found window , with a efficient database 
  
4.MV Theft:
  This is new feature in which police has to show the inquiry they had done in registered case and sufferer also had to admit pics of the stolen vehicle
